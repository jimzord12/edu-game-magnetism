## Project Overview

This project is a physics-based puzzle game where players manipulate magnetic fields to guide a ball to a target. It features two distinct game modes (regular magnets and electromagnets) and a sandbox environment for free experimentation with magnetic forces.

### Key Features

- **Two Game Modes:**
  - **Regular Magnets**: Place attracting/repelling magnets strategically
  - **Electromagnets**: Advanced mode with controllable magnetic field strength
- **Magnetism & Electromagnetism knowledge-testing Quiz**
- **Level-based Progression System**
- **Interactive Sandbox Mode**
- **Real-time Physics Simulation**
- **Visual Magnetic Field Representation**
- **User Authentication and Player Management**
- **Data persistence** using SQLite3 through OPFS (Origin Private File System)

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend Framework:** React + TypeScript + Vite
- **State Management:** Redux (Redux Toolkit)
- **Physics Engine:** Matter.js
- **Rendering:** p5.js
- **Database:** SQLite with Drizzle ORM
- **Testing:** Vitest + React Testing Library

## Architecture

### Design Patterns

1. **Redux Pattern (Flux Architecture)**

   - Feature-based slices organization
   - Centralized store configuration

2. **Feature-First Architecture**

   - Organized by features rather than technical types
   - Modular component structure

3. **Custom Hook Pattern**

   - `useGameEngineMagnet` - Game engine logic
   - `useSandboxEngine` - Sandbox environment
   - `useDB` - Database interactions

4. **Model-View Pattern**

   - Clear separation between models, views, and state management
   - Structured component hierarchy

5. **Inheritance & Composition**

   - Base `Identifiable` class
   - `Magnet` and `ElectroMagnet` class hierarchy
   - React component composition

6. **Singleton Pattern (`GameEngine.ts`)**
   - A dedicated `GameEngine` class (e.g., for Electromagnet mode) implemented as a Singleton ensures a single, persistent instance manages the physics simulation (Matter.js) and rendering (p5.js).
   - This decouples the core game loop and state from React's component lifecycle, preventing resets during UI updates or state changes (like pausing/resuming).
   - It holds the Matter.js engine, p5.js instance, game objects (ball, target, walls, magnets), and internal state (like game status and timer).
   - It provides methods (`initialize`, `update`, `updateMagnets`, `setGameStatus`, `resetBall`, etc.) controlled indirectly by React/Redux via a bridge hook (`useGameEngineBridge`).
   - Uses an observer pattern (callbacks like `onWin`) to notify the bridge hook of internal events.

#### Local Storage Sync Pattern

Utilizes a two-tier storage approach:

- SQLite database (via OPFS) for persistent, relational data
- LocalStorage for quick access and cross-tab synchronization
- Automatic sync on app initialization

#### Service Layer Pattern

Implements a robust service layer pattern for data management:

- Database services for CRUD operations
- Error handling and constraint validation
- Transaction management

#### Redux + Custom Hooks Pattern

Combines Redux state management with React hooks:

- Global state via Redux Toolkit
- Custom hooks for business logic
- Local state for UI components

```

### Authentication Flow

1. App Initialization:

   - Checks for existing database
   - Syncs players between LocalStorage and SQLite
   - Handles storage errors and constraints

2. Player Management:

   - Username-based authentication (no passwords)
   - Unique username constraints
   - Cross-tab state synchronization

3. Error Handling:
   - Graceful handling of duplicate usernames
   - Storage sync error recovery
   - Clear error state management

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- SQLite

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd edu-game-magnetism
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up the database:

```bash
npm run db:migrate
```

### Running the Application

1. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run test` - Run tests
- `npm run db:migrate` - Run database migrations

## Game Architecture

### Physics Implementation

The game uses Matter.js for physics simulation with custom implementations for:

- Magnetic force calculations
- Distance-based force falloff
- Collision detection
- Wall interactions

### Game Mechanics

1. **Regular Magnets Mode**

   - Place attracting (red) or repelling (blue) magnets
   - Strategic positioning to guide the ball
   - Limited number of magnets per level

2. **Electromagnets Mode**

   - Adjustable magnetic field strength
   - More complex puzzle solutions
   - Advanced physics interactions

3. **Sandbox Mode**
   - Free experimentation with magnetic forces
   - No restrictions on magnet placement
   - Educational tool for understanding magnetic fields

## Deployment

### üöÄ Deploying Vite + React App to GitHub Pages with GitHub Actions

This guide helps you automate the deployment of your Vite + React app to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions.

---

### ‚úÖ Prerequisites

- Your app is built with **Vite + React**

  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```

- Repository hosted on **GitHub**
- Default branch is `main` (adjust if it's `master`)

---

### üì¶ 1. Install `gh-pages`

```bash
npm install --save-dev gh-pages
```

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è 2. Update `vite.config.ts`

Set the correct `base` path to match your repo name:
For example, if your repo url is `https://github.com/<your-username>/my-portfolio`, set the base to `/my-portfolio/`.

```ts
// vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  base: '/<your-repo-name>/', // e.g., '/my-portfolio/'
});
```

---

### üìú 3. Add Scripts to `package.json`

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "vite",
  "build": "vite build",
  "preview": "vite preview",
  "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist" // <-- Only this Does NOT exist
}
```

---

### üõ†Ô∏è 4. Create GitHub Actions Workflow

Create the following file (if it doesn't exist) after cloning the repo:

**`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`**

```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main # Change if your default branch is different

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout source code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '20'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Build the site
        run: npm run build

      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./dist
```

---

### üåê 5. Enable GitHub Pages

In your GitHub repository:

- Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Pages**
- Select source: `gh-pages` branch, folder: `/ (root)`

---

### ‚úÖ Result

- Every push to `main` triggers the deployment
- Your site will be live at:

  ```
  https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repo-name>/
  ```

---

### üß™ Optional

To preview your production build locally:

```bash
npm run preview
```

---

Happy shipping! üöÄ
