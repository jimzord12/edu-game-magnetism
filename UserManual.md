Once you're logged in, you'll land on the **Home** screen. From here, you can jump into different adventures:

### 1. Magnet Games 🧲 (Levels 100-199)

- **What is it?** These are puzzle levels where you use regular magnets (like the ones you might have on your fridge, but way cooler!). Some magnets pull things closer (Attract ❤️ - Red), and some push things away (Repel 🔵 - Blue).
- **Your Mission:** Place these magnets carefully on the screen to guide a little ball towards the target. Think like a scientist and figure out the best spots!
- **Challenge:** You only have a limited number of magnets for each level, so use them wisely!

### 2. Electromagnet Games ⚡ (Levels 200-299)

- **What is it?** Ready for a bigger challenge? Electromagnets are special magnets you can turn ON or OFF, and even change how strong they are!
- **Your Mission:** Use these powerful electromagnets to solve trickier puzzles. You'll need to think about timing and strength to get the ball to the goal.
- **Superpowers:** Toggle them, change their pull/push power, and master the magnetic fields!

### 3. Brainiac Quiz Time! 🧠❓

- **What is it?** Test your knowledge about magnets! This quiz has fun questions about everything you're learning.
- **Learn More:** This quiz works great with our learning website! If you haven't seen it, ask your teacher or parent. It has cool pictures and videos that teach you all about magnetism and electromagnetism. The quiz helps you remember what you learned!
- **Your Mission:** Answer the questions and see how much of a magnet expert you've become!

### 4. Sandbox Fun Zone 🏖️

- **What is it?** This is your very own playground! No rules, no goals, just pure fun with magnets.
- **Your Mission:** Drop magnets anywhere, see how they push and pull the ball, watch the invisible magnetic fields, and just mess around! It's the perfect place to understand how magnets work before tackling the tricky puzzle levels.
- **Experiment:** Try different combinations, see what happens when magnets get close, and become a true magnet master!
