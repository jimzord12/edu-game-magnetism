# üóÉÔ∏è Choosing a Storage Solution in the Browser

When building rich web applications ‚Äî especially those with complex, structured data ‚Äî developers typically choose between **two main browser-native storage options**: **IndexedDB** and **OPFS (Origin Private File System)**.

---

## üîπ Option 1: IndexedDB

IndexedDB is a low-level, asynchronous key-value store built into all major browsers. It's well-supported, powerful, and designed for structured storage.

**‚úÖ Benefits:**

- Built-in browser support (no extra permissions or headers required)
- Works offline
- Can store complex objects (via structured cloning)
- Large storage limits (hundreds of MBs)

**‚ùå Shortcomings:**

- Poor developer ergonomics
- No relational data model ‚Äî queries are manual and index-driven
- Hard to migrate or manage schemas
- Difficult to debug or visualize
- Verbose and repetitive APIs

---

## üîπ Option 2: OPFS (Origin Private File System)

OPFS is part of the modern [File System Access API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_System_Access_API), which allows websites to interact with a real (sandboxed) file system ‚Äî enabling powerful storage options like embedded databases (e.g., SQLite).

**‚úÖ Benefits:**

- Persistent, file-based storage
- Enables use of SQLite directly in the browser
- Ideal for apps needing relational data
- More powerful than key-value stores for complex relationships

**‚ùå Shortcomings:**

- Requires **Cross-Origin Isolation** (COOP/COEP HTTP headers)
- Not universally supported (some browser limitations)
- Not visible in DevTools (can make debugging trickier)
- Slightly more complex setup (especially when combined with WebAssembly)

---

## ‚úÖ Our Choice: OPFS

We chose **OPFS** for our project because it provided us with **true relational data support in the browser**, persistence between sessions, and compatibility with **SQLite** ‚Äî the gold standard for local structured databases.

For a game application with interconnected data like players, game sessions, and score history, **a relational database was the most natural fit**.

## üöÄ Enhancing Developer Experience with SQLocal + Drizzle

To accelerate development and improve safety and maintainability, we used **[SQLocal](https://sqlocal.dallashoffman.com/)** ‚Äî a lightweight library that wraps SQLite running in WebAssembly with a smooth developer experience for browser environments.

Even better, SQLocal comes with built-in support for **Drizzle ORM**, a modern, type-safe SQL query builder designed for DX. By using Drizzle:

- We defined our schemas directly in TypeScript
- We generated migration SQL files
- We avoided writing repetitive queries by hand
- We got full IntelliSense and compile-time safety

This drastically improved both the **reliability** and **velocity** of our frontend data layer.

## üß© Challenges We Faced

While the end result was powerful, the path wasn't without obstacles:

### 1. Understanding OPFS Requirements

- We had to enable **Cross-Origin Isolation**, which meant configuring Vite to serve `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy` and `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy` headers.
- Until those headers were in place, SQLite fell back to **in-memory mode**, causing silent data loss on refresh.

### 2. No `exec()` API in SQLocal

- SQLocal uses **tagged template strings** (like `` sql`...` ``), which made it impossible to run multi-line SQL migration scripts directly from a string.
- The `batch()` method was also insufficient in our case.
- We solved this by **manually converting SQL migration files into explicit `await sql\`...\`` statements**, wrapping them in a `createTables()` function. It wasn‚Äôt pretty, but it was reliable and predictable.

### 3. Drizzle doesn't auto-create tables

- Drizzle provides schema typing, but doesn't create tables itself.
- We used Drizzle‚Äôs CLI to generate `.sql` migration files and then executed those via `createTables()` using raw SQL in the browser.

### 4. Debugging Browser-Side SQLite

- OPFS isn‚Äôt visible in DevTools, which made initial debugging more challenging.
- We relied heavily on console logs and test queries to confirm state.
- Importantly:  
  **`persisted: false` does not mean the data will be lost** when the tab or browser closes.  
  It only means the browser **may** clear the storage under memory pressure.  
  In practice, OPFS will still survive across sessions unless manually cleared or evicted by the browser.

### 5. Drizzle Interface Type Conflicts

- When using union types (`DrizzleDB | DrizzleTestDB`) for database instances, TypeScript struggled with method chaining.
- Even though both types supported identical methods, TypeScript couldn't guarantee type safety across the union.
- We solved this by using Drizzle's built-in `BaseSQLiteDatabase` interface, which provided proper type checking with our schema.

### 6. SQLite Timestamp Precision

- SQLite stores timestamps with second-level precision, while JavaScript uses millisecond precision.
- This caused intermittent test failures when comparing timestamps, especially in time-sensitive operations.
- We resolved this by rounding timestamps to seconds in our tests, ensuring consistent comparisons between JavaScript Date objects and SQLite-stored timestamps.

## üèÅ Conclusion

Despite the early hurdles, our final setup using **OPFS + SQLocal + Drizzle** gives us:

- **Persistent, relational storage in the browser**
- **Type-safe querying and schema evolution**
- **A scalable foundation for complex data-heavy PWAs**

It's fast, robust, and developer-friendly ‚Äî everything we need to build a high-quality browser-first game with modern tooling.
