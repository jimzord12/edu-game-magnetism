üß≤ Project Overview
This is a well-structured, feature-rich educational puzzle game built with modern web technologies. The game teaches magnetism concepts through interactive, physics-based puzzles, offering both regular and electromagnet game modes, plus a sandbox for experimentation.

üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Structure
Feature-First Organization:
The codebase is organized by features (e.g., games, levels, player, sandbox), promoting modularity and scalability. Each feature contains its own components, hooks, slices, and types.

Centralized Configuration:
Game and level configurations are managed in config, making it easy to add or modify levels and tweak game parameters.

Models & Physics:
Game objects (Ball, Magnet, ElectroMagnet, Wall) are implemented as TypeScript classes in /models, encapsulating both data and rendering/physics logic. Physics is handled by Matter.js, with custom logic for magnetic forces and interactions.

State Management:
Redux Toolkit is used for global state, with slices for each major domain (magnetGame, electroGame, level, player). Actions follow a command pattern, and slices are cleanly separated.

Custom Hooks:
Complex logic is abstracted into custom hooks (e.g., useGameEngineMagnet, useSandboxEngine, useDB), promoting code reuse and separation of concerns.

Service Layer:
Database operations are encapsulated in service classes under /db/services, following the service pattern for clean data access and business logic separation.

Testing:
There is a foundation for unit and integration testing, especially for the database and Redux slices. The project is set up for Vitest and React Testing Library, with future plans for E2E testing.

üóÉÔ∏è Data & Persistence
Database:
Uses SQLite in the browser via OPFS, wrapped with SQLocal and Drizzle ORM for type-safe, relational data management.

Migrations are managed via Drizzle and executed in the browser.
There‚Äôs a robust service layer for CRUD operations on players, games, and sessions.
LocalStorage is used for quick access and cross-tab sync, with automatic synchronization on app startup.
Error Handling:
The codebase includes thoughtful error handling, especially for database constraints (e.g., unique usernames), and provides clear feedback to users.

üéÆ Game Mechanics
Physics & Rendering:
Matter.js powers the physics simulation, while p5.js handles rendering, including real-time magnetic field visualizations and object interactions.

Level System:
Levels are defined with clear conventions (IDs, wall/magnet configs, start/goal positions, magnet limits).

Regular magnets: static, attract/repel.
Electromagnets: dynamic strength control.
Game Modes:

Regular Magnet Mode
Electromagnet Mode
Sandbox Mode (free experimentation)
üß© Design Patterns & Best Practices
Redux (Flux) Pattern:
Centralized state, feature slices, and command-style actions.

Model-View Pattern:
Models encapsulate logic; React components handle UI.

Factory & Strategy Patterns:
Used for level creation and supporting multiple magnetic force strategies.

Singletons:
Redux store and DB client are singletons.

Dependency Injection:
Context API and hooks are used for injecting shared resources.

Code Style:

Strict TypeScript usage with interfaces and types.
ESLint for code quality.
Conventional commit messages.
üß™ Testing & Quality
Unit and Integration Tests:
Tests exist for models, utilities, and database services.

Test setup scripts for in-memory DBs.
Placeholder for E2E tests.
Manual Testing:
Sandbox mode is used for real-time manual testing.

üå± Extensibility & Contribution
Easy Level Addition:
New levels can be added by editing levels.ts.

Clear Contribution Guidelines:
The project includes detailed CONTRIBUTING.md and in-repo documentation, making onboarding easy for new contributors.

Good First Tasks:
Suggestions for new contributors are provided (UI bugs, new levels, refactoring, etc.).

üí° Strengths
Modern, modular, and scalable architecture.
Strong separation of concerns and use of design patterns.
Robust data persistence and error handling.
Clear documentation and contribution guidelines.
Educational focus with real-time feedback and experimentation.
üõ†Ô∏è Areas for Future Growth
Expand automated test coverage (especially E2E).
Continue to refine error handling and user feedback.
Add more advanced levels and mechanics.
Enhance accessibility and mobile responsiveness.
üèÅ Summary
This codebase is a model example of a modern, educational web game. It combines strong architectural patterns, robust data management, and a focus on learning and experimentation. The project is well-documented, easy to contribute to, and poised for future growth. Great work!
